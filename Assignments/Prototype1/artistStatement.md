In_Visible As It Should Be

about:
Interactive data visualization that represent emotions of good days and/or bad days from invisible illness patients

why:
Bring awareness to what goes beyond external appearance
Fight disbelief and disrespect about patientâ€™s claims
Make public a great number of unnoticed anonymous voices

how:
Collect data from patients - the repository is a Google Form survey, which delivers both XML and JSON files
Flag the data accordingly to parameters that relates to symptoms at a given day and feelings - data is already parsed into variables that can be related to visualization
Associate the parameterized data to visual representation components
Add user interaction to switch between multiple data groups, such as date, feelings, symptoms
